SDK of the LINE Messaging API for PHP.

About the LINE Messaging API
--

See the official API documentation for more information.

English: [https://developers.line.me/en/docs/](https://developers.line.me/en/docs/)<br>
Japanese: [https://developers.line.me/ja/docs/](https://developers.line.me/ja/docs/)

Installation
--

Install the LINE Messaging API SDK using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```
$ composer require linecorp/line-bot-sdk
```

Getting started
--

### Create the bot client instance

The bot client instance is a handler of the Messaging API.

```php
$httpClient = new \LINE\LINEBot\HTTPClient\CurlHTTPClient('<channel access token>');
$bot = new \LINE\LINEBot($httpClient, ['channelSecret' => '<channel secret>']);
```

The constructor of the bot client requires an instance of `HTTPClient`.
This library provides `CurlHTTPClient` by default.

### Call API

You can call an API through the bot client instance.

A very simple example:

```php
$response = $bot->replyText('<reply token>', 'hello!');
```

This procedure sends a message to the destination that is associated with `<reply token>`.

A more advanced example:

```php
$textMessageBuilder = new \LINE\LINEBot\MessageBuilder\TextMessageBuilder('hello');
$response = $bot->replyMessage('<reply token>', $textMessageBuilder);
if ($response->isSucceeded()) {
    echo 'Succeeded!';
    return;
}

// Failed
echo $response->getHTTPStatus() . ' ' . $response->getRawBody();
```

`LINEBot#replyMessage()` takes the reply token and `MessageBuilder`.
The method sends a message that is built by `MessageBuilder` to the destination.

Components
--

### MessageBuilder

The type of message that is sent depends on the type of instance of `MessageBuilder`.
For example, the method sends a text message if you pass `TextMessageBuilder` and it sends an image message if you pass `ImageMessageBuilder`.

For more detailed information on `MessageBuilder`, see `\LINE\LINEBot\MessageBuilder` and the namespace.

Other methods that take `MessageBuilder` behave in the same way.

### Response

Methods that call API returns `Response`. A `Response` instance has following methods:

- `Response#isSucceeded()`
- `Response#getHTTPStatus()`
- `Response#getRawBody()`
- `Response#getJSONDecodedBody()`
- `Response#getHeader($name)`
- `Response#getHeaders()`

You can use these methods to check the response status and take response body.

#### `Response#isSucceeded()`

Returns a Boolean value. The return value represents whether the request succeeded or not.

#### `Response#getHTTPStatus()`

Returns the HTTP status code of a response.

#### `Response#getRawBody()`

Returns the body of the response as raw data (a byte string).

#### `Response#getJSONDecodedBody()`

Returns the body that is decoded in JSON. This body is an array.

#### `Response#getHeader($name)`

This method returns a response header string, or null if the response does not have a header of that name.

#### `Response#getHeaders()`

This method returns all of the response headers as string array.

### Webhook

LINE's server sends user actions (such as a message, image, or location) to your bot server.
Request of that contains event(s); event is action of the user.

The following shows how the webhook is handled:

1. Receive webhook from LINE's server.
2. Parse request payload by `LINEBot#parseEventRequest($body, $signature)`.
3. Iterate parsed events and some react as you like.

The following examples show how webhooks are handled:

- [EchoBot: Route.php](/examples/EchoBot/src/LINEBot/EchoBot/Route.php)
- [KitchenSink: Route.php](/examples/KitchenSink/src/LINEBot/KitchenSink/Route.php)

More information
--

For more information, see the [official API documents](#about-the-line-messaging-api) and PHPDoc.
If it's your first time using this library, we recommend taking a look at `examples` and the PHPDoc of `\LINE\LINEBot`.

Hints
--

### Examples

This repository contains two examples of how to use the LINE Messaging API.

#### [EchoBot](/examples/EchoBot)

A simple sample implementation. This application reacts to text messages that are sent from users.

#### [KitchenSink](/examples/KitchenSink)

A full-stack (and slightly complex) sample implementation. This application demonstrates a practical use of the LINE Messaging API.

### PHPDoc

[https://line.github.io/line-bot-sdk-php/](https://line.github.io/line-bot-sdk-php/)

This library provides PHPDoc to describe how to use the methods. You can generate the documentation using [apigen](http://www.apigen.org/) using the following command.

```
$ make doc
```

The HTML files are generated in `docs/`.

### Official API documentation

[Official API documents](#about-the-line-messaging-api) shows the detail of  Messaging API and fundamental usage of SDK.

Notes
--

### How to switch the HTTP client implementation

1. Implement `\LINE\LINEBot\HTTPClient`
2. Pass the implementation to the constructor of `\LINE\LINEBot`

Please refer [CurlHTTPClient](/src/LINEBot/HTTPClient/CurlHTTPClient.php) that is the default HTTP client implementation.

Requirements
--

- PHP 5.5 or later

For SDK developers
--

Please refer [HACKING.md](/HACKING.md).

### [line-bot-sdk-tiny](./line-bot-sdk-tiny)

A very simple SDK (subset) for the LINE Messaging API for PHP.
line-bot-sdk-tiny provides a simple interface and functions which makes it a good way to learn how to use the LINE Messaging API.
