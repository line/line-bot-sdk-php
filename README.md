# LINE Messaging API SDK for PHP

[![Build Status](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-php/actions/workflows/php-checks.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-php/actions)


## Introduction

The LINE Messaging API SDK for PHP makes it easy to develop bots using LINE Messaging API, and you can create a sample bot within minutes.


## Documentation

See the official API documentation for more information.

- English: https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/overview/
- Japanese: https://developers.line.biz/ja/docs/messaging-api/overview/


## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or later


## Installation

Install the LINE Messaging API SDK using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```
$ composer require linecorp/line-bot-sdk
```

## Getting started

### Create the bot client instance

The bot client instance is a handler of the Messaging API.

```php
$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
$config = new \LINE\Clients\MessagingApi\Configuration();
$config->setAccessToken('<channel access token>');
$messagingApi = new \LINE\Clients\MessagingApi\Api\MessagingApiApi(
  client: $client,
  config: $config,
);
```

You must use the Client with `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface` implementation.

### Call API

You can call an API through the messagingApi instance.

A very simple example:

```php
$message = new TextMessage(['type' => 'text','text' => 'hello!']);
$request = new ReplyMessageRequest([
    'replyToken' => '<reply token>',
    'messages' => [$message],
]);
$response = $messagingApi->replyMessage($request);
```

This procedure sends a message to the destination that is associated with `<reply token>`.

We also support setter style.

```php
$message = (new TextMessage())
  ->setType(\LINE\Constants\MessageType::TEXT)
  ->setText('hello!');
$request = (new ReplyMessageRequest)
  ->setReplyToken('<reply token>')
  ->setMessages([$message]);
try {
  $messagingApi->replyMessage($request);
  // Success
} catch (\LINE\Clients\MessagingApi\ApiException $e) {
  // Failed
  echo $e->getCode() . ' ' . $e->getResponseBody();
}
```

## How to get x-line-request-id header and error message

You may need to store the `x-line-request-id` header obtained as a response from several APIs. In this case, please use `~WithHttpInfo` functions. You can get headers and status codes. The `x-line-accepted-request-id` or `content-type` header can also be obtained in the same way.

```php
$request = new ReplyMessageRequest([
    'replyToken' => $replyToken,
    'messages' => [$textMessage = (new TextMessage(['text' => 'reply with http info', 'type' => MessageType::TEXT]))],
]);
$response = $messagingApi->replyMessageWithHttpInfo($request);
$this->logger->info('body:' . $response[0]);
$this->logger->info('http status code:' . $response[1]);
$this->logger->info('headers(x-line-request-id):' . $response[2]['x-line-request-id'][0]);
```

You can get error messages from `\LINE\Clients\MessagingApi\ApiException` when you use `MessagingApiApi`. Each client defines its own exception class.

```php
try {
    $profile = $messagingApi->getProfile("invalid-userId");
} catch (\LINE\Clients\MessagingApi\ApiException $e) {
    $headers = $e->getResponseHeaders();
    $lineRequestId = isset($headers['x-line-request-id']) ? $headers['x-line-request-id'][0] : 'Not Available';
    $httpStatusCode = $e->getCode();
    $errorMessage = $e->getResponseBody();

    $this->logger->info("x-line-request-id: $lineRequestId");
    $this->logger->info("http status code: $httpStatusCode");
    $this->logger->info("error response: $errorMessage");
}
```

When you need to get `x-line-accepted-request-id` header from error response, you can get it: `$headers['x-line-accepted-request-id'][0]`.



## Components

### Webhook

LINE's server sends user actions (such as a message, image, or location) to your bot server.
Request of that contains event(s); event is action of the user.

The following shows how the webhook is handled:

1. Receive webhook from LINE's server.
2. Parse request payload by `EventRequestParser#parseEventRequest($body, $channelSecret, $signature)`.
3. Iterate parsed events and some react as you like.

The following examples show how webhooks are handled:

- [EchoBot: Route.php](/examples/EchoBot/src/LINEBot/EchoBot/Route.php)
- [KitchenSink: Route.php](/examples/KitchenSink/src/LINEBot/KitchenSink/Route.php)

If it's your first time using this library, we recommend taking a look at `examples` and the PHPDoc of `\LINE` .

Hints

### Examples

This repository contains two examples of how to use the LINE Messaging API.

#### [EchoBot](/examples/EchoBot)

A simple sample implementation. This application reacts to text messages that are sent from users.

#### [KitchenSink](/examples/KitchenSink)

A full-stack (and slightly complex) sample implementation. This application demonstrates a practical use of the LINE Messaging API.

### PHPDoc
https://line.github.io/line-bot-sdk-php/

This library provides PHPDoc to describe how to use the methods. You can generate the documentation using phpDocumenter using the following command.

$ wget https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor/releases/download/v3.3.1/phpDocumentor.phar
$ php phpDocumentor.phar run -d src -t docs
The HTML files are generated in docs/.

### Official API documentation

[Official API documents](#documentation) shows the detail of  Messaging API and fundamental usage of SDK.

### Laravel Support
Easy to use from Laravel.
After installed, add `LINE_BOT_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` to `.env`

```
LINE_BOT_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Channel Access Token>
```

then you can use facades like following.

```
$profile = \LINEMessagingApi::pushMessage(....);
```

Facade uses `\GuzzleHttp\Client` by default. If you want to change the config, run

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```

Then `line-bot.php` will be published to `config/` dir.
If you want to configure a custom header, do the following.

```php
return [
    'channel_access_token' => env('LINE_BOT_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN'),
    'channel_id' => env('LINE_BOT_CHANNEL_ID'),
    'channel_secret' => env('LINE_BOT_CHANNEL_SECRET'),
    'client' => [
        'config' => [
          'headers' => ['X-Foo' => 'Bar'],
        ],
    ],
];
```
